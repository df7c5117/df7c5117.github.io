In 2007, Li Chih returned to his 9 to 5 job in Chengdu. Before then, he had just packed up and pretended to leave his house in a hurry, made believe he was doing a decent job.

The year before, he had released his third album, which, same as the previous two, still with no improvements. He came to Chengdu to work off his debts. He had never expected that in a year's time he would have to go through thick and thin with this city and this province; nor did he foresee that ten years later he returned to this piece of land and by which failed him in mixed sentiments.

In the midsummer of 1997, he ended his college life with a piece of paper. There was no a single tree thicker than his arm in the Pukou campus of Southeast University at that moment when he stepped out of the president's office. He didn't look back for even one last glance.

It was a dazzling, brand-new factory in which he had smashed his beloved guitar.

He knew it wasn't what he wanted. He didn't know indeed what he longed for

He rented a house in Luozhuang Village and taught nearby students guitar at the price of ¥80 for 10 lessons. Before the red balloons pondered in the gloomy sky over Nanjing that winter, Li Chih's ideal was not to farm. Having done all sorts of farm work at home, he came to realize  that knowledge was the only key for him to be qualified for putting on a pair of leather shoes. But now the thrill has gone. He wanted to try to live in Beijing.

It was in vain.


<br>


Li Chih kept heading west.

In 2004, Li Chih went to Western Xia tombs with his classmates. Amid the splendors of the azure sky and yellow earth, he grasped that even those who had been mighty enough to have their military troops, their own territory and dynasty were now reduced to a single mound. Back in Nanjing, he immediately put together a demo of the songs he had written before. He thought he would have to at least leave something to this world even at any cost, and if any, death.

Goddammit.

He broke his word. After spending ¥5,000 burning 200 copies, Li Chih sold them in piracy disc shop. But it was unexpectedly dreadful to listen to. He faltered to sign on their covers.

So _The Forbidden Game(2004)_, presented by B&B, is one of the sources of the _**B**_ in Li Chih’s nickname.

Then followed _Mr. Van Gogh(2005)_ and _Has Man a Future? (2006)_. He didn’t sell much until _In Love with Nanjing(2009)_.

Afterwards he took his drug records out to the suburb and set them on fire. Such kind of performance art is the second source of the _**B**_ in Li Chih’s nickname.

He became popular with the fire.


<br>


That famous passage _We Want to Get Close to Li Chih_, written by himself in _Douban_, is about the stories of the girls he loved or had sex with in his youth. He ranks them from A to S. During that period of time, because of his ugly appearance and poverty state, he did not harvest any love. He had never had a good meal either. He refused others’s well-intentioned dinner lest he failed to pay the bus fare. He hid in the bathroom, smoked CRANBERRY which only cost￥3 per pack. When Spring Festival came, he could barely eat with his head down, crestfallen, unable to cope with various inquiries people put forward at the dinner table.


> I've always believed that people should be honest, with their flaws and their strengths. You can try to fix your defects, but you can't lie or deny them for the sake of an upright image. We are not that perfect.
> <div style="display:flex;justify-content:flex-end"><p>Li Chih</p></div>

He was not satisfied with his fame after being brainlessly praised and nobody respects him when he was in his low ebb. He scolded his fans in his debut, "Are you all deaf and blind? Has everyone lost their minds? Don't you people have ears? "

35 shows in 70 days, Li Chih finished the last one in _Gebi Livehouse_ in Yiwu. On the final night of 2009, Li Chih sang _Mr.Van Gogh_ like an 18-year-old with a hangover. That day was a bow to the past, he paid off his debts. He vowed that he would not sing _Mr. Van Gogh_ again ever since in the midst of a restless, turbulant crowd.

He wasn't content with the fact that his songs were sung over and over again. He was furious that his work had been unauthorized covered on a talent show, and thus he engaged a law suit at all costs, even though those were his only two most-popular songs to the public.

He hates anyone that misbehaves and makes a rule that one will be charged if he/she is late for the rehearsal. However he was accused for discreditable behaviors this year.

A person who is way too glittering, in whatever context of chronicles are doomed to be unpopular with the majority. Therefore, he is not being understood or accepted, he is always a lonely individual, born to be alone.

In a sense, he's like _Mr. Van Gogh_ he sings about.


<br>


T started listening to Li Chih from the Song _Mr. Van Gogh_. He describes himself as an atypical Li Chih fan. The masses only know _Memories of Zhengzhou_ or _the Castle In Sky_ or other popular-corny songs. Normal fans are familiar with classic songs like _Nanjing Summer_, _Re He Road_ and _Walls of Sunflowers_. T, however, loved _Klan River_, just as he likes the 18-minute deluxe edition of _Qinhuangdao_, by _Omnipotent Youth Society_.

N and T have known each other for over eight years. One year in a southern city at the end of summer, after N failed another confession, T shared _Donia_ with him. That was the second time N had listened to Li Chih.

N put his songs on the playlist. He broke down when he heard _Rice Shop_.


By the end of that summer, N was on a loop, from The Forbidden Games to Lizhi, Band and Orchestra II. He listened to Li Chih’s scream, "Mom, I can't believe I'm in love with her". That summer, _The adventure of live music_ was on tour in Shandong with difficulties. N was on the train bounded for Qingdao, Li Chih’s was at the Oriental Film Metropolis Grand Theatre. The next day, it was just another brush against.

<br>

### Why can't I brace myself up

T has revealed some of his relationships, for instance, he has also ranked the girls, but not using alphabet. He has so far numbered to 9. N Always says T has more than nine girlfriends. But unfortunately, these relationships often end up in confusion and annoyance under certain situations. The response is always, "There's nothing wrong with you, You are nice, but just don’t suit me" or "I want to be your friend forever" which is always an awkward dialogue.

Genes dictate that no matter how rational our upper body is, one can not resist the primitive urges of the lower part. A civilized society needs to restrain its primitive instincts, but it does not mean that primitive instincts hinder the development of civilization. According to T's own account, some of the girls on this list are unable to fantasize because their brains resist the idea that a once-good relationship would descend into a kind of sexual surrogate, so-called SAGE state. It's like Li Chih ripping off the yogurt cover and started to lick it after having intercourse with a girl.

T decided to listen to Li Chih's music to alleviate the anxiety and pain caused by iteration. This period of time T’s Netease Cloud Music App ranking board will usually be dominated by Li Chih. This trend will decline as life becomes ever more abundant. So then T and N introduced a new concept called the Li Bi Index (LBI) , a statistic measuring how much fulfillment one owns, which is defined by the ratio of songs played by Li Chih amongst the whole number of songs in the list one is listening to over a period of time. If one has very high LBI, it may indicate that he/she was lovelorn. So, don't listen to Li Chih when you are moody.

Physiological period of the boys does not have apparent harbingers distinctively, but may be triggered by few things. T and N often wonder how it was that the girl they were chatting to suddenly stops talking to them, or they shared some links with a girl but she didn't respond, later they found that she was surfing her WeChat Moment, or, the girl often showed off her female friends but never wanted to hang out with them.

It is physically arduous for an animal in love to think rationally without being suspicious. As a consequence, this animal will be bizarrely sensitive to everything the other says, hypothesizes multiple parallel universes and guesses at the course of the world line based on the telltale signs of each other's openness. Speculation, please note here. It will inevitably go back to the ultimate questions: Does she like me or not? Does she even have feelings on me? There's no way she doesn't have any feelings on me! Is She sick of me? Should I cool it down?

Nerveless. The solution is always listen to what Li Chih says.

Though claiming having received rigorous science and engineering training of thinking, Li Chih is also an emotional animal for sometimes. He travelled to Zhengzhou alone simply just to see his girl. T and N would also run to their girl's residences without a call in advance, to see them, to love them and then quietly slipped away. N later realized that dwelling on these issues could have a huge impact on productivity, relationships, and moods. How do you expect your d\*\*k to perk up when you can't even lift your own spirit up?

<br>

### To the other side of the Yangtze River Bridge

Y is N's classmate. They lived in the same dorm when they started their internship. In the afternoon, N headed out for the sea and found a bag full of seashells on the beach of Lingshanwei.

The setting sunlight glinted to and for on the well-cleaned tiles. Y was sitting beside the bed with the other student.

The pattern of NEZHA's head was spinning on the phone's screen.

Don't stop my music. Gao Hu sang.

> They were playing _Don't stop my music_ by _Miserable Faith_. I said, fuck yeah! Did you listen to _Omnipotent Youth Society_? The answer was positive. _No Party for Cao Dong_? Yes. _Hedgehog_? Yes. _New Pants_? Yes. Listen to Li Chih? Damn, of course.
> <div style="display:flex;justify-content:flex-end"><p>N</p></div>

Y said he wanted to go to Nanjing for a visit on the National Holiday. Beforetime he went to Zhengzhou. On the night he arrived in Nanjing, he did go to Re He road.

It reminded N of the feelings of going to Nanjing for the first time. N said that the last-minute decision to go to Nanjing was the craziest decision in this year. And he did not inform anyone basically.

Because of his lateness, N have only bought a stand-by ticket, which meant he would set off at dusk, stay up all night on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, and walk out of Nanjing Railway Station on his feet the next day.

At three o'clock in the morning, N boarded a train from the northernmost tip of mainland China in Jinan, which runs through the heart of the land. If everything goes well, the train will arrive in Shanghai, the most developed cities of the Yangtze River Delta or even of China, in the afternoon. But before that, it would make a brief stop in Nanjing.

It's an amazing feeling that some of the cities suddenly became familiar like your hometown even before you have arrived. People in love can be seen on Re He road when you take Bus No.32 through the Yilang Gate, and the 200 meters graffiti wall has been wiped inside out for 33 times.

By the Qinhuai River, the lights festival began. The lanterns were full of adulations of Nanjing written by literati. The construction of the city is not so good as imagined. Having gone through six dynasties, within the vicissitudes of the ancient eras, hence its unhidden charm, the streets are similar to where N has once lived. The sound of water cuffing on the banks of Qinhuai River weaves its melody deep inside the genes of the city, and the bustling throngs of lights and shadows are dreamlands that ramparts indulge can’t be waken from.

Nanjing is full of Chinese parasol trees, people said Chiang Kai-Shek planted them. A hundred years later, they are still fluffing amid midsummer, people dare not look up nor stop.

Shan Yin Road still has no eighth-floor rooms, the roads are still narrow, people are walking unhurriedly, drying their quilts on balconies, accustomed to people taking pictures around street signs.

Everyman who came to Nanjing would attempt to tease out his/her relationships with the city, the country and this world.

You need a reason to love a city, and a reason to hate vice versa. N does not like Beijing, simply because it is the center of authorities and resources. But if they were switched, the results would probably be different. Beijing has its wounds; Nanjing has Nanjing's pain. In recent history, they have been of equal stance. People are still living the same life; nothing can defeat them.

<br>

### Being earnest is how we change the world

Li Chih is always in favor of instilling values in the audience during his performances. He feels that some behaviors of his fans are signs of sheer rudeness. He feels like a monkey at the zoo when he encounters his delirious fans on the street.

As an everyday citizen, Li Chih emphasizes that the most correct thing for everyone is to take their own job properly, take responsibility for himself and this world.

It seems to be a tedious process; how do we define DO A THING SERIOUSLY?

One of the things that Li Chih did when he started to be a dissenter on the Internet was having written an article called _Cursing and Common Sense_. There is a sentence in the article, "HaoMeimei's music is rubbish, is it a curse or a view?" which have led to a long-running dispute in the comments section. And it spreaded right up to Ma Di’s side.

> I feel like, shite, I haven't been paying this much attention to such kind of audience thinking for a long time. I wondered, how come after all these years, there’re still so many imbeciles? Afterwards, lots of people asked me, can you talk about Ma Di? But I didn't even hear of him at that time. I used to know this guy, and then I went back and listened to some of his songs. I think it's crap. I didn't say much. I just thought it was a kind of bad song, and it was rubbish in my life. And then there's a bunch of comments, and I'm like, what the fuck is going on with these assholes, it's 21st century, we're all highly educated, why can't we accept one person's evaluations of the others? 
> <div style="display:flex;justify-content:flex-end"><p>Li Chih</p></div>

One of the things he reckons essential to discuss is that it was wrong not to allow people to criticize the things or people they love, or to praise the things and people they hate. The second is when discussing an idea, you should try to avoid discussing the person who said it. The third is that each person is responsible for his or her own views, which often requires honesty, not the correctness of views. Fourth, what Chinese lacks most is not opinion but honesty, and an honest attitude towards others.

He once joined a number of independent musicians to write a petition to Xiami, claimed a withdraw of the unauthorized music on the platform. Later, after Xiami began to protect the rights of musicians, he authorized Xiami to release his new album in no time.

> There is no enmity between us, only right or wrong.
> <div style="display:flex;justify-content:flex-end"><p>Chi Bin, Li's ex-agent</p></div>

Some time ago, Li Chih struggled with seasoned copyright trolls until he won a legal battle by pouring money out of his pocket. Li's performance art reached its summit when he showed his disdain for the people who inflated themselves, and it urged him to compose the self-published book _NiMaBi_, which fill with character **X**. He wanted to hold a music tour that would make people all over the country experience live music but for some reason, he failed.

> I’m not talented, I have only a moderate amount of knowledge, I have a little higher IQ than the average. For generations our family have been farmhands. There's only one TV in the village, no extra-curricular books to read. No one was capable of tutoring your work, and I, being able to go to a key university, then dropped out of school, engaged in this profession without any friends, and now do well, sometimes I feel very conceited innermost of my heart that luck was just a tiny part of it, that I made it all by myself. 
> <div style="display:flex;justify-content:flex-end"><p>Li Chih</p></div>

Being earnest comes with a price. Does he care about what other people think and comment? Is it worth doing it? His Japanese lighting master, Ayako Hayakawa, had cried to him, "Foreigners have understood your work. What you have done has changed their views of China. But why can't people understand what you do in China? "

Because this country needs to get better.

Performing is a meticulous business. On Ola's first day, the air conditioning on the lot broke down. Li Chih tied a pigtail, mopped the floor on the stage. Although this person often forgets the words and sings blindly in the performance, but each Live is different. In contrast to some of the singers, he rearranged the music every New Year's Eve, and for most of the time, the Live version is far superior in quality to the studio version.

Music is a meticulous business. In the 2013 edition of _Together With You_, the trumpet is introduced as a prelude, as if paying homage to _Omnipotent Youth Society_'s _Qinhuangdao_. The entire repertoire was accompanied by an orchestra on the 2017 & 2018 New Year Countdown. The 2018 edition of _Ostrich_ and _Six Pounds for Weng Qingnian_ also included jazz elements, while _Divorce_ and _Re He Road_ were heavenly with the chant of piano and acoustic guitar. The 2019 edition of _Hangzhou_ has taken on a new significance. And his most eminent acme, the 2014 i/O New Year's Eve concert, was an unsurpassable classic. _Walls of Sunflowers_, _Nanjing Summer_, _Pencil_, _Black Envelopes_, and square-dancing-liked _the Castle in Sky_ are still songs recur again and again in many people’s playlists.

Artists's vocation is to infect people with their art. Music, he says, is monotonous as a work. But music, as music itself, is moving. He doesn’t think he is much gifted, and his success today is mostly due to his diligence and good fortune. In fact, it's the same in any industry. What Li Chih is better than some other musicians is that he DO THINGS NO ONE ELSE CAN.

<br>

### Has man a future?

Amongst the three strangers who had influenced him most in his youth, N awarded the third place to Li Chih. The first two were Lu Xun and Wang Xiaobo. N said he was grateful that these three men were presented at a time when his values were being shaped, which luckily prevented him from becoming a part of the rabble.

Li Chih, as a typical person who has received rigorous science and engineering training of thinking, is thoughtful and serious about his viewpoints. Compared with the ordinary netizens who think naively, he will not hesitate to express his own perspectives and advocate dialectical thinking. He has _science democracy freedom_ tattooed on his back and a map of China tattooed on his belly. Laughter and love is not antithetical.

Both N and T have a shirt printed _science democracy freedom_. They hope one day they can wear them to Li Chih's show.

Since 2009, a New Year's Eve concert will be held in Nanjing at the end of each year. Li Chih is without doubt a well-deserved hero. Such New Year's Eve has become an iron law of the city and a symbol of Nanjing. At the end of 2018, Li Chih felt tired and did not sell tickets to the public, but only invited some of his audience and friends to attend his New Year's Eve. By the end of 2019, Nanjing was lonely.

On November 9, Ola Art Space sent out a passage. There was not a single line mentioning Li, but it's all about him. Members of the band have become regular guests at other musicians' performances, except its owner, Ola’s boss, who yet remain behind the veil. But in some of the musicians' songs, the name Li Chih is hidden among the producers. He seems to be accustomed to his behind-the-scenes life, cloaked behind the spotlight of that name, to do something real.


"How happy I would be if no one was observing me. "


<br>

Li is already in his 40s.

He believes that it is his duty to confront and discuss social reality. He feels that what needs to be discussed in detail was a junior question to whether we could talk about it. Who are we supposed to sing to? _The Kidney_ said we’re meant to sing to the masses of the proletariat, but only the Avant-guards listen to them. Modern citizens shall not lie in the middle of nowhere, hallucinating about all the sore realities we cannot change. The obligation of modern citizens is to make the world a better place, not for just one person, one group, or one specific category of people.

It was Li Chih word, _I live to make the world a better place_. He invited his parents over on New Year's Day Live to officially announce that he had a decent job. He stopped asking if everything would be all right, for the world may still be the way it is even after our deceases. This is an idealist's wish, and an idealist's social responsibility. He is the one who sets the tone, the upright thinker with incomparable charisma; he is the cultural landmark of Nanjing; he is the glory and pride of Nanjing rock music.
